# Studio-Unity-Project

I worked on this Unity game project as part of my Game Studio course in my final year of college, meant to simulate the industry environment as best as possible.

My professor acted as an upper level administrator, overseeing all of the project teams working within the course. After assembling the teams, my professor was completely 'hands off' with the teams. It was up to each individual team to design, document, create assets, and complete the game adhering to only a few specifications (Certain number of mechanics, Having a wrapper with title screen and credits, and win/loss conditions)

It should also be noted that this project was completed on a completely remote basis, as Covid-19 restrictions prohibited us from working on campus in the lab. Many responsibilities aside from simply the scripting were left up to me due to adapting to remote work with a team. I was also the only programmer on the team.
